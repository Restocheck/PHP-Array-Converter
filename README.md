Converts the old php array syntax to the php5.4 syntax

# Requirements

python 3

# Usage

Supply at least one file to the script
python convert.py file.php [file2.php [ ... ]]

# Note

This will work incorrectly if you have other programming languages embedded in your php file (eg javascript) that also use the array() syntax
